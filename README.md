# Atomic Growth dashboard - React Admin & Dashboard Template
https://www.atomic-growth.com

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node 12.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quick Start

### Run locally

The project is set up to run against the staging environment (that's the best way to test it). To run it:

* Execute `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
* Open the dashboard in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* Click the 'sign up' for new users, enter your email address and create your own login credentials.
* You may now log into the dashboard to test your frontend work.

Note that the page automatically reloads if you make any changes. Also make sure to see any lint errors in the console.

## Pre-commit

Always check that your code passes the linter before creating new Pull Requests (PRs). You can run the linter locally by typing:
```bash
$ npm run lint
```

Some linting problems can be resolved automatically by running
```bash
$ npm run lint-fix
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## React App documentation

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Theme

The web app uses the [Mira Pro React Theme](https://mui.com/store/items/mira-pro-react-material-admin-dashboard/). The live demo is available [in this link](https://mui.com/store/previews/mira-pro-react-material-admin-dashboard/).

The entire theme including all components is available in the `theme` folder.
